# Stress Less: A Guide Through The Hard Times  
**By Abdul Johnson**

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health through a data storytelling approach. Using self-reported global data from 824 respondents, the analysis examines mood swings, coping struggles, and emotional stress across various demographics â€” including age, gender, occupation, and quarantine duration.  
The goal is not just to visualize the data, but to humanize it â€” to remind viewers that behind every statistic is a personal story.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used  
- Tableau Public (for interactive visualizations)  
- Microsoft PowerPoint Online (for final presentation)
